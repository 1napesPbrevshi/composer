## How does JPS Virus Maker work?
 
JPS Virus Maker works by inserting or attaching itself to a legitimate program or document that supports macros in order to execute its code[^2^]. When the infected program or document is opened, the virus code is executed and the virus spreads to other files and programs on the computer. The virus can also spread to other computers on the same network or through email and text message attachments, Internet file downloads, and social media scam links.
 
The virus can cause unexpected or damaging effects, such as harming the system software by corrupting or destroying data[^2^]. It can also steal passwords or data, log keystrokes, spam your email contacts, or even take over your machine[^2^]. Some viruses are designed with financial gains in mind and can extort money from the victims or use their resources for illegal activities.
