There are a few possible solutions that you can try, depending on your system and graphics card. Here are some of them:
 
- **Disable the onboard CPU graphics**. Some laptops have both an integrated and a dedicated graphics card, and sometimes the game may try to use the wrong one. To fix this, you can go to your BIOS settings and disable the onboard CPU graphics, or set the dedicated graphics card as the primary one. You can also right-click on the game's executable file and select "Run with graphics processor" and choose your dedicated graphics card.
- **Switch to high performance mode**. Another reason why the game may not recognize your DX11 capable GPU is because your laptop is in power saving mode, which may limit the performance of your graphics card. To fix this, you can go to your power options and select "High performance" mode, or create a custom plan that allows your graphics card to run at full speed.
- **Download DirectX 11 from Microsoft**. Even though Windows 10 comes with DirectX 12, some games may still require DirectX 11 to run properly. To fix this, you can download and install DirectX 11 from Microsoft's website [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17431). Alternatively, you can try installing the DirectX setup file from the game's redist folder, if it has one.
- **Update your graphics card drivers**. Sometimes, the error may be caused by outdated or corrupted graphics card drivers. To fix this, you can go to your graphics card manufacturer's website and download the latest drivers for your model. You can also use a driver updater software to automatically scan and update your drivers.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will help you fix the error "You need a DX11 capable GPU to play Crysis 3" and enjoy the game. If none of them work, you may need to upgrade your graphics card or contact the game's support team for further assistance.
