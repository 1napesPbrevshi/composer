# How to Edit Your Characters and Save Files in Artificial Academy 2
 
Artificial Academy 2 is a simulation game by ILLUSION that lets you create and interact with a variety of characters in a school setting. You can customize their appearance, personality, clothes, and relationships, as well as play through different scenarios and events. However, if you want to edit your characters or save files after creating them, you will need a special tool that can read and modify the game data.

There are two main tools that can help you edit your characters and save files in Artificial Academy 2: ReiEdit-AA2 and AA2QtEdit. Both of them have similar features, such as:
 
- Load characters from game save or editor directories
- Export any loaded characters
- Edit any character property available in ILLUSION's editor
- Unlock character properties (body sizes, hair lengths, etc.)
- Customize random items, with gender/personality locks
- Customize personality selector
- Character clothing editor with full support to .cloth files (import/export, loadable in-game)
- Pregnancy risk and H-compatibility editor
- Save game play data support

The main difference between them is that ReiEdit-AA2 is older and requires .NET Framework 4.0 or higher to run, while AA2QtEdit is newer and requires Windows 10 or 11 to run. AA2QtEdit also has some extra features, such as:

- Add support for extra hair flips
- Limit combobox size in card data view to window size
- Replace clothes slot checkboxes with radio buttons
- Aware of AAUnlimited data (not editable)

To use either of these tools, you will need to download them from their respective GitHub pages[^1^] [^2^] and place them in your AA2 folder. Optionally, you can also download the companion XML files to add support for additional user-made DLC content. They must be located in the same folder as the executable file.
 
Once you have installed the tool of your choice, you can launch it and load your characters or save files from the File menu. You can then edit any aspect of them using the tabs and menus on the interface. When you are done, you can save your changes by clicking on Save or Save As from the File menu.
 
Editing your characters and save files in Artificial Academy 2 can be fun and rewarding, as it allows you to customize your game experience and create unique scenarios. However, you should always backup your original files before making any changes, as editing them may cause errors or glitches in the game. Also, you should respect the original creators of the game and the modding tools, and not distribute or claim their work as your own.
