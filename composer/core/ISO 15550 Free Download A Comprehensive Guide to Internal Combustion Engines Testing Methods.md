Why is ISO 15550 important? ISO 15550 is important because it provides a common and consistent way of declaring and testing the performance of internal combustion engines. This helps to ensure the quality and reliability of the engines and to avoid confusion or misunderstanding among the users and manufacturers. It also helps to facilitate the trade and exchange of engines and related products across different countries and regions.
 
How is ISO 15550 developed? ISO 15550 is developed by ISO technical committee ISO/TC 70, which is responsible for internal combustion engines. The committee consists of experts from various countries and sectors, such as engine manufacturers, users, regulators, researchers and testing laboratories. The committee follows a consensus-based process to draft, review and approve the standard. The standard is reviewed periodically to ensure that it reflects the latest technology and best practices.
 
What are some examples of applications of ISO 15550? ISO 15550 can be applied to a wide range of internal combustion engines that use liquid or gaseous fuels, such as gasoline, diesel, natural gas, biogas, hydrogen or ethanol. Some examples of applications are road construction machines, such as excavators, bulldozers, rollers and graders; industrial trucks, such as forklifts, cranes, loaders and dumpers; and other applications, such as generators, pumps, compressors and agricultural machines.
