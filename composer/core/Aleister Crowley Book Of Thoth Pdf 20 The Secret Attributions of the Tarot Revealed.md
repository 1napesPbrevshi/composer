# Aleister Crowley's Book of Thoth: A Guide to the Tarot of the Egyptians
 
Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) was a notorious occultist, magician, poet, and writer who had a profound influence on modern esotericism. He was also the founder of Thelema, a religious philosophy based on the motto "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law".

One of his most famous works is *The Book of Thoth*, a short essay on the Tarot of the Egyptians, which he wrote in collaboration with the artist Frieda Harris. The book was first published in 1944, and it contains Crowley's interpretation of the 78 cards of the Tarot deck, as well as an invocation and a mnemonic system for memorizing them.
 
The Book of Thoth is not a conventional guide to the Tarot, but rather a complex and symbolic system of correspondences that draws from various sources, such as astrology, alchemy, Kabbalah, numerology, mythology, and Egyptian lore. Crowley claimed that his book revealed the secrets of the ancient wisdom that was encoded in the Tarot cards by the initiates of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a secret society that he belonged to in his early years.
 
The Book of Thoth is divided into three parts: Theory of the Tarot, The Atu (Keys or Trumps), and The Court Cards and Small Cards. The first part explains the general principles and structure of the Tarot, as well as its relation to other systems of knowledge. The second part describes each of the 22 major arcana cards in detail, giving their names, symbols, meanings, attributions, and correspondences. The third part covers the 16 court cards and the 40 minor arcana cards, which are grouped into four suits: Wands, Cups, Swords, and Disks.
 
The Book of Thoth is not an easy read, but rather a challenging and rewarding study for those who are interested in exploring the depths of Crowley's occult vision. It is also a beautiful and artistic work, thanks to the illustrations by Frieda Harris, who painted each card according to Crowley's instructions. The original paintings are now housed in the Warburg Institute in London.

The Book of Thoth is not only a source of information, but also a tool for divination and self-discovery. Crowley believed that the Tarot cards could reveal the hidden aspects of the human psyche and the forces that shape our destiny. He also devised a method of using the cards for magical purposes, such as invoking and banishing certain energies, creating talismans, and performing rituals.
 
To use the Book of Thoth for divination, you need a deck of cards that follows Crowley's design and symbolism. There are several versions available on the market, such as the Thoth Tarot deck by U.S. Games Systems, or the Crowley-Harris Tarot deck by AGM Urania. You also need to familiarize yourself with the meanings and attributions of each card, as well as the different spreads and layouts that you can use to arrange them.

One of the most common spreads is the Celtic Cross, which consists of 10 cards that represent various aspects of a situation or a question. The first card is placed in the center and represents the present or the general theme. The second card is placed across the first one and represents the challenge or the obstacle. The third card is placed above the center and represents the goal or the best outcome. The fourth card is placed below the center and represents the foundation or the past. The fifth card is placed to the left of the center and represents the past influences or the recent events. The sixth card is placed to the right of the center and represents the future influences or the near future. The seventh card is placed at the bottom of the layout and represents the self or the attitude. The eighth card is placed above the seventh one and represents the environment or the external factors. The ninth card is placed above the eighth one and represents the hopes or fears. The tenth card is placed at the top of the layout and represents the outcome or the final result.
 
To interpret the cards, you need to consider their individual meanings, their positions in the spread, their interactions with each other, and their relation to your question or situation. You also need to use your intuition and imagination to find patterns and connections that make sense to you. There is no definitive or objective way to read the cards, but rather a personal and subjective one that depends on your own perspective and experience.
