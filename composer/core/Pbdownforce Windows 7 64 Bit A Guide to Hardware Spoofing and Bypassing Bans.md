## What is Pbdownforce?
 
Pbdownforce is a small program that can spoof or change the hard disk serial number of your computer. The hard disk serial number is a unique identifier that is assigned to your hard disk by the manufacturer. It is different from the volume serial number, which is assigned by Windows when you format a partition and can be changed using some software tools. The hard disk serial number is used by some software programs to generate a hardware ID, which is then used to activate or register the software. Some online games that use PunkBuster anti-cheat system also use the hard disk serial number to ban cheaters from their servers.
 
Pbdownforce can change the hard disk serial number by hooking into the system calls that read the serial number from the hardware. It can spoof any serial number you want, as long as it follows the format of 8 hexadecimal characters separated by a dash (e.g. 1234-5678). Pbdownforce works on Windows XP and Windows 7 32 bit, but it does not work on Windows 7 64 bit or higher versions of Windows. This is because Pbdownforce uses a driver that is not digitally signed and cannot be loaded by the 64 bit kernel.

## How to use Pbdownforce on Windows 7 64 bit?
 
There is no official way to use Pbdownforce on Windows 7 64 bit, but there is a workaround that involves disabling the driver signature enforcement feature of Windows. This feature prevents unsigned drivers from being loaded by the system, which is a security measure to prevent malware from infecting your computer. However, disabling this feature also exposes your computer to potential risks and may cause system instability or crashes.
 
To disable driver signature enforcement on Windows 7 64 bit, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Restart your computer and press F8 repeatedly during boot to enter the Advanced Boot Options menu.
2. Select "Disable Driver Signature Enforcement" and press Enter.
3. Wait for Windows to load normally.
4. Run Pbdownforce as administrator and enter the new serial number you want.
5. Click "Spoof" and wait for Pbdownforce to change your hard disk serial number.
6. Reboot your computer to apply the changes.

Note that this method only works temporarily until you restart your computer again. If you want to keep using Pbdownforce, you need to repeat these steps every time you boot your computer. Alternatively, you can use a tool like EasyBCD to edit your boot configuration and add an option to disable driver signature enforcement permanently. However, this is not recommended as it may compromise your system security and stability.
 
## What are the risks and alternatives of using Pbdownforce?
 
Pbdownforce is not a safe or reliable tool to change your hard disk serial number. It may cause errors or system instability, especially on Windows 7 64 bit or higher versions of Windows. It may also damage your hard disk or make it unreadable by some programs. Moreover, using Pbdownforce may violate some software licensing agreements or online game terms of service, which may result in legal consequences or account bans.
 
If you want to change your hard disk serial number for legitimate reasons, such as replacing a faulty hard disk or cloning a system image, you should use other tools that are more compatible and safer than Pbdownforce. For example, you can use Hard Disk Serial Number Changer, which can change the volume serial number of your partitions without affecting the hard disk serial number. You can also use VolumeID, which is a command line tool from
