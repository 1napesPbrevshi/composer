# How to Download and Use Symbolic Math Toolbox 5.2 for MATLAB
 
Symbolic Math Toolbox is a MATLAB add-on that allows you to perform symbolic math computations, such as solving equations, integrating functions, simplifying expressions, and more. You can also generate MATLAB functions, Simulink function blocks, and Simscape equations directly from symbolic expressions, or share your work using the MATLAB Live Editor.

Here are some examples of how to use Symbolic Math Toolbox 5.2 for MATLAB:

- To solve an equation, such as `x^2 + 3*x - 4 = 0`, type `solve(x^2 + 3*x - 4 == 0)` and press Enter. The output will be `x = -4` or `x = 1`.
- To integrate a function, such as `sin(x)`, type `int(sin(x))` and press Enter. The output will be `-cos(x)`.
- To simplify an expression, such as `(x^2 + x - 6)/(x^2 - 9)`, type `simplify((x^2 + x - 6)/(x^2 - 9))` and press Enter. The output will be `(x + 3)/(x + 3)`.
- To plot a function, such as `y = x^3 - x`, type `fplot(x^3 - x)` and press Enter. A figure window will open with the plot of the function.
- To generate a MATLAB function from a symbolic expression, such as `y = x^3 - x`, type `matlabFunction(x^3 - x)` and press Enter. The output will be `@(x)x.^3-x`, which is an anonymous function that you can use in MATLAB.
