One of these tools is Lectra Modaris V8R1 (EXPERT version) with 3D Prototyping, the latest version of Lectra's patternmaking, grading and prototyping 2D/3D solution. This solution offers a number of features and benefits that can make a difference in the fashion industry, such as:
 
- **Realism:** Lectra Modaris V8R1 (EXPERT version) with 3D Prototyping provides a high level of realism in 3D simulations, thanks to its compatibility with Vizoo, a high-quality scanner that captures the appearance of fabric swatches, and other 3D solutions such as Maya, 3DS Max and Iray. The solution also has a rich library of assets, such as fabrics, 3D top-stitching effects, realistic scenes, lighting studios, PantoneÂ® and Natural Color SystemÂ®Â© colors.
- **Speed:** Lectra Modaris V8R1 (EXPERT version) with 3D Prototyping allows patternmakers to develop patterns faster and speed up their decision-making processes. The solution has a special dart feature that reduces the time needed to modify a dart by half, resulting in a 50-90% increase in overall patternmaking speed. The solution also enables patternmakers to share 360-degree videos with their partners, accessible on any device, and to collaborate with designers using the new 3D Style module.
- **Efficiency:** Lectra Modaris V8R1 (EXPERT version) with 3D Prototyping helps patternmakers reduce or eliminate physical prototyping, saving time and money. The solution also helps ensure size compliance across different measurement systems used in different countries where production occurs. Moreover, the solution helps improve the quality and fit of the garments by allowing patternmakers to visualize, comment and approve the style and fit using 3D simulations.

Lectra Modaris V8R1 (EXPERT version) with 3D Prototyping is already being used by leading brands in fashion and apparel, such as GGZ, an Italian womenswear company that reported a 50% reduction in pattern modification time and a significant reduction in lead times thanks to the solution.
