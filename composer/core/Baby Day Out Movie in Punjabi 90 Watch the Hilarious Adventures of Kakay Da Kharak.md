Baby's Day Out is not only a comedy movie, but also a family movie that can appeal to both children and adults. The movie has a simple and heartwarming message about the bond between a baby and his parents, who never give up on finding him. The movie also shows how a baby can bring joy and wonder to the people he encounters, such as a friendly bus driver, a kind-hearted security guard, and a gentle gorilla.
 
However, Baby's Day Out is not without its flaws. Some critics have pointed out that the movie is too similar to the Home Alone series, also written by John Hughes, and that it lacks originality and creativity. Some have also argued that the movie is unrealistic and implausible, as the baby escapes from one dangerous situation after another without any harm or supervision. Some have also found the movie to be too violent and cruel, as the kidnappers are subjected to various forms of physical abuse and torture, such as being hit on the head, burned, bitten, and crushed.
