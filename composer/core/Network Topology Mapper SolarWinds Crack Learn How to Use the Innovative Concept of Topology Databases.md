Network Topology Mapper (NTM) is a network mapping software that automatically discovers and diagrams network topology. It supports multiple discovery methods, exports network maps to various formats, and delivers reports on switch ports, VLANs, subnets, and inventory. NTM is developed by SolarWinds, a leading provider of IT management software.
 
However, NTM is not a free software. It costs $1495 for a single license, which may be too expensive for some users. If you want to use NTM without paying for it, you may be tempted to look for a crack or a keygen that can bypass the license activation. But is it worth it?

In this article, we will explain why cracking NTM is a bad idea and what are the risks and consequences of doing so. We will also suggest some alternatives that can help you map your network topology without breaking the law or compromising your security.
 
## Why Cracking NTM is a Bad Idea
 
Cracking NTM may seem like an easy way to save money and get access to a powerful network mapping tool. However, there are many reasons why you should avoid doing so. Here are some of them:

- **It is illegal.** Cracking NTM violates the End User License Agreement (EULA) that you agree to when you install the software. It also infringes the intellectual property rights of SolarWinds and may expose you to legal actions or penalties.
- **It is unethical.** Cracking NTM deprives SolarWinds of the revenue that they deserve for developing and maintaining the software. It also undermines the efforts of the legitimate users who pay for the software and support its development.
- **It is risky.** Cracking NTM may introduce malware or viruses into your system that can compromise your security and privacy. It may also damage your system files or corrupt your network data. Moreover, cracked versions of NTM may not work properly or have limited functionality.
- **It is unreliable.** Cracked versions of NTM may not receive updates or patches from SolarWinds that can fix bugs or improve performance. They may also be incompatible with newer versions of Windows or other network devices. Furthermore, cracked versions of NTM may not have technical support or customer service from SolarWinds in case of any issues or problems.

## What are the Alternatives to Cracking NTM
 
If you want to use NTM but cannot afford to pay for it, there are some alternatives that you can consider instead of cracking it. Here are some of them:

- **Try the free trial.** SolarWinds offers a free 14-day trial of NTM that you can download from their website[^1^]. The trial version has all the features and functionality of the full version and allows you to map up to 10 devices on your network. You can use the trial version to evaluate NTM and see if it meets your needs and expectations.
- **Look for discounts or promotions.** SolarWinds occasionally offers discounts or promotions on their products that can help you save money. For example, as of February 2023, you can save 15% on NTM with code FEBFLASH15 when you buy online through their website[^1^]. You can also check their website regularly or subscribe to their newsletter for any updates on their offers.
- **Explore other network mapping software.** There are other network mapping software that you can use instead of NTM that may be cheaper or even free. For example, you can try Spiceworks Network Mapping[^2^], which is a free web-based tool that can scan your network and create interactive maps with customizable icons and labels. You can also try Nmap[^3^], which is a free open-source tool that can perform network discovery and security auditing using various techniques and protocols.

## Conclusion
 
Network Topology Mapper by SolarWinds is a powerful network mapping software that can help you automate device discovery and mapping, build multiple maps from a single scan, perform multi-level network discovery,
