Nitrobake 3 is a plugin for Cinema 4D that allows you to bake your scene into keyframes and export it to another software. It can handle all of Cinema 4D's objects and generators, Standard and Thinking Particles, Xparticles, MoGraph, Hair and Dynamics. It is a powerful, fast and intuitive way of creating animations and simulations without relying on caches or external files.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Nitrobake 3 for Cinema 4D R21 and up. You will need to purchase the plugin from [Nitro4D's website](https://nitro4d.com/product/nitrobake3/) and install it in your Cinema 4D folder. You will also need to enter your Maxon license count, Profile-ID or System-ID and 11-Digits when you add the plugin to your cart.

Once you have installed the plugin, you can access it from the Plugins menu in Cinema 4D. To use it, simply select the objects or tags that you want to bake and click on the Nitrobake button. You can adjust the settings in the Nitrobake interface, such as the start and end frames, the sample rate, the bake mode and the output options. You can also choose to bake everything in a single mesh or as separate objects.
 
When you are happy with the settings, click on the Bake button and wait for the process to finish. You will see a new object or objects in your scene with keyframes on every frame. You can then export these objects as FBX, OBJ or any other format that your target software supports.
 
Nitrobake 3 is a great tool for creating complex animations and simulations in Cinema 4D and exporting them to other software. It saves you time and disk space by avoiding caches and external files. It also gives you more control and flexibility over your baked objects.

## Examples of using Nitrobake 3 for Cinema 4D
 
Nitrobake 3 can be used for a variety of purposes and projects in Cinema 4D. Here are some examples of what you can do with it:
 
- Bake complex MoGraph animations and export them to game engines or other 3D software.
- Bake dynamic simulations such as cloth, soft bodies, rigid bodies and particles and export them as keyframes or meshes.
- Bake procedural objects and generators such as cloners, deformers, splines and volumes and export them as editable meshes.
- Bake Xparticles systems and export them as point clouds or meshes.
- Bake hair and fur simulations and export them as splines or meshes.
